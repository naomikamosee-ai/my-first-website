<h1>Hi! My name is Naomi Macharia</h1>
<p>The below image is my beloved pet 🐶</p>

<p>My pet's name is <strong>Arsen</strong>. He is a male Chihuahua, and I love him more than words can express. I bought Arsen when he was just a tiny puppy. The moment I held him in my hands, I knew he was going to be a very special part of my life. From the first day, he filled my home with energy, joy, and endless laughter. He has such a playful spirit and a personality much bigger than his small size!</p>

<p>Every morning, Arsen greets me with his tiny yaps and wagging tail. We go for walks together, play fetch in the garden, and cuddle on the couch while I sip my coffee. He has a curious nature and loves exploring every corner of the house. Even when he gets mischievous—like sneaking under the table or hiding his toys—his adorable face always melts my heart.</p>

<p>Arsen has a favorite little blanket and a squeaky toy he carries everywhere. Watching him chase his toys and run around makes me laugh every single day. He’s also incredibly smart! He learned to sit, shake hands, and even roll over in just a few weeks. We have a special bond; he knows when I’m happy, when I’m sad, and always stays close to comfort me.</p>

<p>I often take pictures of him to capture our precious moments, and I share them with friends who are always amazed at his cute expressions. Arsen is not just my pet; he’s my companion, my little buddy, and a true friend who makes every day brighter. I feel so lucky to have him in my life, and I will always care for him and love him endlessly. ❤️</p>
